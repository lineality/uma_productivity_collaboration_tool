#### Project Areas & Problem-Examples 
#### v16
1. Process: Workflow Type, STEM Integration & Data-Definitions, Values, Agenda, Methods, Policies (including for predictable issues problems and collapse elements: scope-churn, panic-halting, planning-blackout), Coordinated Decisions, (Data/System)Ecology: Collapse & Productivity (default option: Agile, Kahneman-Tversky, Definition-Studies)
-- process/policy areas may be seen as preventable-predictable-collapse-areas; each is an area of preventable mistakes that are not automatically self-preventing and that must be deliberately prevented. Problems that are not automatically visible or understandable can repeat indefinitely. Using process and policy can significantly help prevent and navigate recurring problems that are not automatically visible.
-- not accounting for different workflows (e.g. frontend, backend, data-science, production machine-learning, R&D, test-reporting, etc.) will lead to delays and failures that should not have occurred. In the absence of communication and learning, these failures may be invisible and repeat indefinitely because they are not seen and understood. 
2. Schedule: (Duration; Start date; Iteration Interval)
-- Timelines that need to be short but are never articulated or planned for are unlikely to usually spontaneously match the needed short scale planning needs.
-- Timelines that need to be long but are never articulated or planned for are unlikely to usually spontaneously match the needed long scale planning needs.
-- Undiscussed timelines risk being indeterminate, fickle, and unpredictably changing for no apparent reason, raising the risk of endemic liabilities such as churn, panic, and repeatedly returning to square one.
-- Picking initial MVP goals, milestones, indicators, and both allotting and using time and resources for feedback (where that feedback is also to be used) is one location where time and schedules are deeply interwoven with other project areas.
3. Users: Stakeholders & Needs & Goals Evaluation (of users)
-- Not having and coordinating with users/stakeholders and their needs significantly raises the probability that the project will not improbably, spontaneously, meet unknown and possibly unarticulated needs of unknown people by accident.
-- A user describing their difficulties is not the same as a user outlining an ideal solution, or even accepting a viable solution.
-- Not properly doing a needs and goals evaluation significantly raises the risk of goals being either incorrectly identified, or having goals indefinitely changing or rotating between amorphous unexamined but often entirely predictable areas.

4. Features_Goals: User-Features & Subfeatures/Under-The-Hood Features including design factors such as Categories of Types of Systems, Data-Types, Data-Structures, Structured Vs. Unstructured Data.(E.g. tech-stack and resources may be implicit for higher-level goals or explicit for resource-defined needs); lexicon: clarify jargon vs. description; 
- From a user-story standpoint, what is this project making? 
- From an Under-the-hood standpoint, what needs to be made and how for the project to be maintainable?
- Are these known? Do these need to be researched?
-- If you do not have a clear articulation of what you are doing (for a user/stakeholder to meet their clarified need) then it is unlikely that the possibly unknown goal will be accomplished in a maintainable way meeting the need of the user/stakeholder.
-- If you do not distinguish between and elucidate both user-story level features and sub-user-story level features (features/subfeatures) then quality, efficiency, and maintainability will be undermined.
5. MVP: 'MVP's (Minimum Viable Products); Deliverables Checklist;
Tools, 'Tool Stack / Tech Stack',
- Each MVP must not be an invocation of a reification-hallucination. 
- Iteratively proceeding with transparency and feedback to align and fine-tune is appropriate and time-tested in many projects.
- Articulating incremental MVP (minimum-viable-product) goals and stepping stones is an important part of progressing and communicating incrementally and/or progressing maintainably and sustainably. 
- Articulating incremental MVP (minimum-viable-product) goals and stepping stones is a skill in and of itself.
-- Without timely iterative MVP deliverables, feedback from the user about features and usability will be significantly hindered.
-- Without data and feedback about initial MVP outcomes, blindness will strangle the management of the project, coordination of people, and the management of resources.
6. Feedback_Learning: Learning, Tests, Communication, Signals, Documentation & Iteration, Organizational, System, and 'Ecological' Effects, (~Agile); Documenting-teaching-learning(skills); present skills, future skills (learning)
- Based on what signals will you define failure and orient to measure productivity?
- Whether formal or informal there must be effective ways of communicating what has been done within the project-team and between the project-team and the user/stakeholder.
- Long term maintainability involves communication (including with 'future you').
-- Failing to clearly map and communicate the differences between jargon terms and goal descriptions will result in mis-alignment between people and nonsense in planning.
-- The default patterns and processes of drift will misalign the team and user-stakeholders on many levels, making even detection of the misalignment a challenge.
-- Learning directly and indirectly related to the specific project is necessary. If you do not learn that a user/stakeholder's need is not being met then long term failure is highly probable. If you continually learn and develop useful skills then long term successes are more probable.

## Managing general project areas as per the details and needs of each project (as described by that project's general project areas) is best practice for positive and sustainable aligned process and project outcomes.
## Advocacy and support tools for 'process' 
#### Policy on Feedback, Errors, Mistakes, & Transparency: a process for reporting feedback (there needs to be a process and team-cultural permission to handle feedback and data): [2025.04.27]
- handling the predictable 'culture vs. data' conflicts:
-- rejecting [data, feedback, results, process, policy,] as being [disloyal, disrespectful, contrary to hierarchy-status, conspiracy, disobedience, etc.]
- Handing perception issues in goals choices
-- attractive reifications and abstractions (especially when undefinable)
- Definability of targets, goals, tasks, and solutions.
- An awareness of frequent but by default invisible areas of project mis-definition and mis-alignment and breakdown (project areas above)
#### moving from aspirational brainstorm definitions to implementable and maintainable definitions
