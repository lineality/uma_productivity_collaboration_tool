"A knight on the fifth rank is worth (at least) two pawns."
~ Gary Kasparov (a favored quote of Hikaru Nakamura)

## Scope and Goals:
Uma's primary goal is to provide simple, secure, and decentralized collaboration tools for small (maker, build, and research) teams collaborating on projects.

Decentralized: No central server; each user runs their own instance of Uma and syncs directly with other collaborators.

Secure: Uses GPG for authentication and encryption to ensure data integrity and confidentiality. Each user owns and signs their own files, and chooses who they share files with.

Minimal: Focuses on essential team-administration features (instant messaging, task management, voting, etc.). This scope is not a replacement for git, google-drive, aws, etc. 

Modular: Designed to be easily adaptable and extensible for future uses, features, etc.

Accessible: Students, startups, and anyone with limited resources should still be able to have access to best-practice project alignment tools. 


### Six items for the use-case/context for Uma: 
- Aligned 
- Hygienic 
- Coordinated/Collaborative 
- Data-STEM 
- Productive 
- Projects

Many activities do not include these characteristics. That is fine. If a project does, Uma should be useful.  

# Best Practice
## Definition Behavior & System Collapse
## Tools for Project Management (non-collapsing projects)
- Alignments
- Scope
- Tasks
- Needs & Goals Definitions (not process reification illusion or goal reification illusion)
- Externalization



## Uma Collaboration Software 
- In memory of Eleanor Th. Vadala 1923-2023: aviator, astronomer, engineer, pioneer, leader, friend, ethical role model, good person.

- In memory of Walter Pergamenter: liberated from Auschwitz at the age of six after WWII; worked as an architect; a good person; taught me fundamental concepts of decentness and civility. 

- For Clarence 'Skip' Ellis whose project Neem (a team collaboration assistance agent-based project in the late 1990's early 2000's) was a foundational experience including Prof. Skip's insistence that the MCU portion of the software be considered with attention and not dismissed as a simple generic component.

- In praise of the still very much alive and working Steve Gibson of GRC and 'Security Now,' sharing sound advice and guidance for computer scientists.

- In respect of Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, whose work on systems and information is pervasively important to many fields including computer science, the still nascent study of learning, and project management.
